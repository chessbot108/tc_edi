Our three favorite gyrating cats, Peach, Goma, and PurpleCrayon are all looking at a set of N (5 <= N <= 1e5) points on a coordinate plane (1 <= x[i], y[i], <= 1e9). PurpleCrayon with his superior intellect (some number we have lowerbounded at 1e9 +7) convinced Peach and Goma that they should both take 1 point each (2 in total) and leave PurpeCrayon with the rest. PurpleCrayon will then evalute the area of the convex hull in O(1) time, write it down, then retype the proof of P=NP again that many times. As cats are curious, Peach and Goma ask Q queries (1 <= Q <= 1e5) where each query is two integers a and b (1 <= a,b <= N) where Peach takes point a, and Goma takes point b. As Purple is busy cleaning up his proof for Rieman's hypothesis, linear 3-SUM (and 3-SAT for that matter), and matrix mult in O(n^2) time, he would like you to find the area of the convex hull with points a and b removed for him. Also, the problemsetter, chessbot, does not want to deal with precision issues, so please find the area of the convex hull multiplied by 2 instead of as a fraction. Note that since all input points have integer coordinates, finding the convex hull mulitplied by 2 will make the new area an integer. Proof is by magic or left as an exercise to the reader :D. Also, note since the problemsetter, chessbot, does not like making edge cases, all of the points will be uniformly and randomly generated using the following code https://pastebin.com/AwLt3khD. 


Input:

The first line will contain two integers N, Q (5 <= N <= 5e5, 1 <= Q <= 5e5). The following N lines will contain two integers each, the x and y coordinates of each of the N points (1 <= x,y <= 1e9). The following Q lines will contain two integers each, a and b representing the query (1 <= a, b <= N, a != b). Note that despite the points being randomly generated, the queries will not be randomly generated but rather made to fit the testcases.

Output:

Q lines, one integer per line representing the answers to the queries. The i'th line should be the area of the convex hull with the points a and b of the i'th query removed multiplied by two. Note the answer may not fit into a 32-bit integer. 

Sample Input:

5 2
1 1
1 5
5 5
5 1
3 3
1 2
3 5

Sample Output:
8
16

Explanation:

The input points look something like a 4x4 grid with corners at (1, 1), (1, 5), (5, 5) and (5, 1) with one point at the center, (3, 3). 
In the first query, we are removing points (1, 1) and (1, 5). The remaining points, (1, 5), (3, 3), and (5, 5) make up a triangle that is 45-45-90 and has side lengths 2*sqrt(2), 2*sqrt(2), 4. The area is ((2*sqrt(2)) * (2*sqrt(2)))/2, which is 4 (proof is left as an exercise to the reader). Then multiply the area by 2 and the answer is 8.
In the second query we are removing points (5, 5) and (3, 3), leaving us with (1, 1), (1, 5), and (5, 1). This also gives us a 45-45-90 triangle but with side lengths 4, 4, 4*sqrt(2). The area of the figure (or the convex hull of the figure, they are the same in this case) is (((4) * (4))/2) or 8. Multiply that by two to get 16.
