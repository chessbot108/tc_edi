# Vivy's Singularity Project

## statement

Vivy is carrying out the singularity project! She is currently at the start of everything at event $0$. Unfortunately, $N$ $(1 \leq N \leq 10^5) $ more timeline changing events are about to occur. Luckily, Vivy has picked a special number $X$ $(1 \leq X \leq 10^9)$ to assist her project. When the $i$th event occurs, a random number $A$ from $0$ to $X-1$ is generated. Then, it becomes possible to go from event $(A \mod i)$ to event $i$ and event $i$ is considered a child of event $(A \mod i)$. If after all events occur, event $0$ has more than $2$ children or there exists an event $i$ such that $i > 0$ and it has more than $1$ child, the timeline becomes unstable and only a tragic future where AIs are bent on eradicating humanity awaits. If no such event exists, the singularity project is successful and humans and AIs live happily ever after. As Vivyâ€™s partner, you want to test the value of $X$ and determine the probability that the singularity project is successful.

## input format

The first line contains one integer, $T$ $(1 \leq T \leq 10^5)$, the number of test cases. Then $T$ test cases follow.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers, $N, X$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.

## output format

The probability that the singularity project is successful for each test case can be expressed as a fraction $\frac{P}{Q}$. For each test case, output $P \cdot Q^{-1}$ modulo $10^9+7$. $Q^{-1}$ is the modular inverse of $Q$, so $Q \cdot Q^{-1} \equiv 1 \mod 10^9+7$.

## sample explanation

For the first test case, event $1$ must be a child of event $0$ because the random number $A$ must be $0$ and $0 \mod 1 = 0$. We end up with timeline $0 \rightarrow 1$. Event $1$ has no children and event $0$ has $1$ child, so the singularity project was successful. The probability and answer is $1$.


For the second test case, again, event $1$ must be a child of event $0$. Additionally, event $2$ must be a child of event $0$ or event $1$. We end up with either timeline $2 \leftarrow 0 \rightarrow 1$ or $0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2$. In either case, event $0$ has at most $2$ children and no event $i$ such that $i > 0$ has more than $1$ child. The probability and answer is $1$.


For the third test case, again, event $1$ must be a child of event $0$. Event $2$ is a child of event $0$ when the random number $A$ is $0,2,$ or $4$ and a child of event $1$ when $A$ is $1$ or $3$. Thus the timeline $2 \leftarrow 0 \rightarrow 1$ occurs with probability $ \frac{3}{5} $ and the timeline $0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2$ occurs with probability $\frac{2}{5}$. For the first timeline, event $3$ is a child of event $2$ when the random number $A$ is $2$, a child of event $1$ when $A$ is $1$ or $4$, and a child of event $0$ when $A$ is $0$ or $3$. If event $3$ is a child of event $0$, event $0$ has more than $2$ children and the timeline becomes unstable. It is fine for event $3$ to be a child of event $1$ or $2$ though. Thus, the timeline $3 \leftarrow 2 \leftarrow 0 \rightarrow 1$ occurs with probability $\frac{3}{25}$ and the timeline $2 \leftarrow 0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 3$ occurs with probability $\frac{6}{25}$. Similarly, the timeline $0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3$ occurs with probability $\frac{2}{25}$ and the timeline $3 \leftarrow 0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2$ occurs with probability $\frac{4}{25}$. These are all the final timelines where the singularity project is successful. The probability is thus $\frac{3 + 6 + 2 + 4}{25} = \frac{3}{5} $. Since $3 \cdot 5^{-1} \equiv 3 \cdot 400000003 \equiv 200000002 \mod 10^9 + 7$, the answer is $200000002$.
