Note that the graph of teleports makes a directed acyclic graph with $1$ or more components each having one endpoint which all nodes in that component lead to. Then all we have to do is go through all the teleporter start points and assign the final position it goes to. Save the final end point each teleporter goes to, which makes it so that you can find the endpoints of all teleporters in $K$ time. Bfs can then be used to finish the problem. the complexity is $O(N^2)$.
