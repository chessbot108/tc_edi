It makes sense to iterate over the number of rectangles in the final painting to make our life easier. How many paintings have $X$ rectangles? Realize that in each column and row, if there are $1$s they will belong to only $1$ rectangle. This means that the set of columns and rows that have a $1$ is a property of every painting. 

Let's go from this set to the painting then. If we select $X$ disjoint intervals (for example $2$ disjoint intervals could be $[1,3]$ and $[4,5]$) for the rows and columns separately, this can uniquely determine $X!$ rectangles. The $X!$ rectangles come from a permutation $P$. If we fill in $1$s in the intersection of the $i$th interval for the rows and $P_i$th interval for the columns, we end up with a unique painting. 



Let $S_i$ be the number of distinct ways to choose $i$ disjoint intervals. Then the answer to the problem is: 

$$\sum_{i} i \cdot {S_i}^2 \cdot i!$$

 What is $S_i$? Using stars and bars, it's just ${N}\choose{2i}$ (The stars are the indexes of the row/column. The $i$ intervals need to have at least width $1$ so we subtract $i$ stars. There are $2i+1$ sections (intervals or gaps between intervals) so we insert $2i$ bars and choose $2i$.). 

By precomputing the mod of factorials and inverse factorials, we can find the sum for each $i$ in $O(1)$ time.



Time complexity: $O(N)$
