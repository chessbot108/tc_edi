# Tree Width Editorial

Note: I probably overestimated the difficulty of this problem. I made a solution that ran in $O(n \cdot tree\ depth)$​​ that might have used linear memory if i changed it. Most submissions ran in $O(n \cdot tree\ depth)$​​​ memory as well as time. I didn't realize it was so much easier to implement using a bottom up method if you could store the entire dp table with mle.



The first important observation is that the height of a modtree is rather small, you could have arrived at this conclusion from guessing, seeing that it's close to a random tree and random tree's have low depths, or making the assumption that the height of the modtree is log2 since mod is half. By running a $5e5^2$ brute force you can find that the largest depth a modtree goes up to is $42$ with $n =493919$ .



## definitions

Let's define $cnt[i][j]$ as the amount of nodes with distance $j$ away from node $i$. Node $i$ has distance $0$ from itself.

Now let's define $temp[i][j]$ as the amount of nodes in node $i$'s subtree. (Note we root the tree at node $0$). 

$par[i]$ is the parent of node $i$, parent of the root is undefined.

$dep[i]$​ is the depth of node $i$​, $dep[0]$​ = $0$​.

## solution

Then we have
$$
cnt[i][j] = cnt[par[i]][j - 1] + temp[u][j] - temp[u][j - 2]
$$
Note that in this equation if ever you access a negative index, it is just $0$.

 

So in words, the amount of nodes distance $j$ away from node $i$ is

1. the amount of nodes distance $j - 1$ from the parent of $i$. This is the amount of nodes up the tree that contribute to the answer. Note this overcounts since there are also some nodes with distance $j - 1$ from $par[i]$ within $i's$ subtree. We will handle the overcount in case 3
2. the amount of nodes distance $j$ from node $i$ in $i's$​ subtree. This is the contribution down the tree on in $i's$ subtree.
3. subtract the amount of of nodes in $i's$ subtree distance $j - 2$ from node $i$. These are the nodes that are overcounted in case 1. Since these nodes have distance $j - 1$ from $par[i]$ but do not have distance $j$ from node $i$. 

The answer is then $\max(cnt[i][j])$ over all $i$ and all $j$. 

I think most teams made the above observations, but our implementations are different.

So let's say I find $cnt[0][j]$ for all $j$. Then I want to transition from each parent to their child. We can just compute the $temp$ array for the child and then loop over all relevant $j$ and recompute $cnt[i][j]$ and take the max. The I repeat the process from the children. The total complexity runs in $O(\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} subtree \ size\  of\ i)$. This evaluates to $O(n \cdot tree\ depth)$. Consider the sum of all subtrees of all nodes with a fixed depth from the root. The sum of all of these subtrees is at most $n$ since each node can only belong to one subtree of a node of a certain depth. So the sum of all subtrees is around $O(n \cdot tree\ depth)$. 



In my implementation, I don't actually store all $cnt$ and $temp$ values. Instead whenever I recurse, I first store the values in the $cnt$ array, but then I edit the array and restore it at the end.
