Peach and Goma were playing with trees, and Peach had a new idea. Note all trees will be 0-based, or all nodes of a tree with n vertices will be [0, n). She defined the width of a rooted tree as the maximum number of nodes that have the same depth from the root. Consider the tree (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 4). The width of the tree rooted at node 0 is 2, (nodes 2 and 4 having a distance of 2 away). However, the width of the tree rooted at node 1 has a width of 3, (nodes 0, 2, and 4 having a distance of 1 away). Peach asked Goma to find the maximum width of a tree with n nodes (2 <= n <= 2e5) across all possible roots.

However, chessbot (the problemsetter), is lazy and decided to give you trees as input with the following format. A tree with n nodes is defined by an integer n. For all nodes i [1, n) there is an edge between i and n%i. It can be proven that for all n, the tree will be connected and satisfy the property of a tree. Note is n%i not i%n and that the tree is labeled 0-based....

A tree with 4 nodes will have edges, (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 1).

Input:

You will answer T testcases (1 <= T <= 5e5). There will then be T lines with one testcase each. The i'th testcase consists of a single integer n (1 <= n <= 5e5), the number of nodes on the modtree. It is guaranteed that the sum of n will not exceed 5e5.

Output:

You will output T lines, one line per testcase, the i'th line denoting the maximum width of the i'th tree across all possible roots.

Sample input:

3
4
5
100

Sample output:

2
3
37

Explanation

The edges of the first tree are described in the problem statement, and the width cannot be larger than 2. Rooting the tree at node 1, for instance, will give a width of 2 (nodes 0 and 2 being distance 1 away).
The second testcase was also described in the problem statement, rooting the tree at node 1 will give a width of 3.
Due to the difficulty of drawing a tree with 100 nodes, proving the third sample input will remain an exercise to the reader.
