For this problem, we need to have a way of checking the “difference” between two words. We do this by traversing through each letter and seeing if they're the same or not, and seeing how many letters are the same, and how many aren’t. If there is exactly one letter pair that is off, then we know that that word is the word we’re looking for. After we traverse through each given word, checking for the difference, we can find the correct words that we need for the order, then we print that out.
