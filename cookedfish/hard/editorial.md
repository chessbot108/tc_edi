Note this is for the original problem and not for the case of minimizing $a$ in the answer. rip my checker....

This problem is spilt into three main cases. $k \geq 3$, $k = 2$, and $k = 1$. 



## $k \geq 3$ 

Let's try solving it for $k = 3$. We can see that once we take a value greater than $10^6$ or ${10^{18}}^{\frac{1}{3}}$,  ${10^6}^{k}$ will exceed n. Then if we define $arr = \{1, 2^3, 3^3, \cdots, {10^6}^3\}$, then the problem is reduced to finding a subarray with a sum of $n$. Then we can run an $O(n^{\frac{1}{3}})$ two pointers brute force to find the answer. For all $k \geq 3$, we can solve it in $O(n^{\frac{1}{k}})$ time.



## $k = 1$

If $n$ is not a power of $2$ , there is a solution. Let's prove it. So for a valid solution $(a, b)$, lets define $k = b - a$ (like the easy version). Again, $k$ here does not refer to the $k$ in the problemstatement but rather $b - a$. So we have
$$
n = k \cdot a + \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}
$$
  and
$$
2n = 2\cdot k \cdot a + k \cdot (k + 1) = k \cdot (2a + k + 1)
$$
So we know that $2n$ has an odd and an even factor since the parity of $k$ and $(2a + k + 1)$ are different. So if $n$ is a power of $2$, then there are not two such factors. Also if we can find any two valid factors, they make a solution since we can use it solve for $a$ and $b$. So now if have some $n$ which is not a power of two, we can trivially find an even factor, lets call it $y$ as the largest power of $2$ that divides $2n$. Then we define $z = (2n)/y$. So we know that $\abs{z - y}$ is $2*a +1$ and that $\min(y, z)$ is $k$. Then we can solve for $a$ and $k$ and output $(a, a + k)$ as our answer. Complexity $O(1)$ or $O(\log n)$ depending on the implementation.



## $k = 2$

Let's use our idea for the easy version here. So for a valid answer $(a, b)$ we have $n = \sum_{i = a}^{b - 1} i^2$​. If we define the sum of integers from $[0, i]$ as $sum(i)$ and the sum of squares from $[0, i]$ as $sumsq(i)$, we can start simplifying
$$
n = \sum_{i = a}^{b - 1} i^2 = \sum_{i = 0}^{b - a - 1} (a + i)^2 = \sum_{i = 0}^{b - a - 1} a^2 + 2ai + i^2 = (b - a) \cdot a^2 + \sum_{i = 0}^{b - a - 1} 2ai + i^2 = (b - a) \cdot a^2 + 2\cdot a\cdot sum(b - a -1) + sumsq(b - a - 1)
$$
Which again is a sum that can make $a$ only relative to $n$ and $b - a$. For the $(b - a) \cdot a^2$ term, i just took it out of the sigma, for the $2 \cdot a \cdot sum(b - a- 1)$ i used distributive property on the sum of integers from $[0, b - a - 1]$, and i just wrote $sumsq(b - a - 1)$ since that's what the sum of all the $i^2$ was.



Now believe it or not, we can make a quadratic such that when give $n$ and $b - a$, we can solve for a.
$$
(b -a) \cdot a^2 + (2 \cdot sum(b - a - 1)) \cdot a + (sumsq(b - a- 1) - n) = 0
$$
Now we can plug it into the quadratic formula and use $(b - a)$ and $n$​ to solve for $a$.
$$
a = \frac{-(2\cdot sum(b - a - 1) \pm \sqrt{(2\cdot sum(b - a - 1)^2 - (4)(b - a)(sumsq(b - a - 1) - n))})}{2 \cdot(b - a)}
$$
Now when $sumsq(b - a - 1) - n > 0$ , the square root of the discriminator will simplify to be less than $2 \cdot sum(b - a - 1)$ and the entire equation will be negative. Since $sumsq$ grows cubicly, we only have to check around $n^{\frac{1}{3}}$ values of $b - a$. But this is not all, evaluating $sqrt$ takes $O(\log n)$ time. So we have a complexity of $O(n^{\frac{1}{3}} \log n)$ which happens to be too slow.



**I have no proof of the following heurstic, but it somehow speeds up the code by around 20 times**. So now as we loop over $b - a$, evaluating $sqrt$ is the most time consuming part. But you can notice that if the value in the $sqrt$ is not divisible by $i^2$, there is no chance that it'll simply to $a$ being an integer. So the optimization is to simply not eval $sqrt$ and continuing if the discrim for a certain $b - a$ is not divislbe by $i^2$. The end complexity is at most $O(n^{\frac{1}{3}} \log n)$, but I can't prove what it actually is.



## apology

I really did not think that the grader was wrong for this :<. My model solution is ac but some code that only handles the case when $k = 1$ is also ac. In fact, harry submitted code that 

```cpp
cout << "-1\n"
```

and its ac. sorry and i hope it was still a good problem :<.
