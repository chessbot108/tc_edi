The sum of consecutive k numbers from [a to a+k) can be represented in the form of a*k + ((k) * (k - 1))/2. If you imagine numbers as towers with that height, the a*k is the part all of the numbers share and the ((k) * (k - 1))/2 is using the triangle equation to find out what the leftovers total to. So now we have s = ((k) * (k - 1))/2 and X = a*k + s. Then we can rearrange the equation to X - s = a*k. So now we just have to check if X - s is divisible by k, and if so (X - s)/k = a and we have an answer. Now if s > X we wont have an answer, and for only O(sqrt(X)) values will the resulting s be <= X. So it suffices to generate all possible k's and check if we can make an answer of length k and use any as our output. Complexity: O(sqrt(n)) per testcase.
