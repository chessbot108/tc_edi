The solution to this problem is to binary search over the final answer time, then run a function to check whether or not each answer is possible. To find if a time $v$ works as the answer or not, we can loop through all the people and sum how much money each of them made by time $v$. The amount of money the $i$th person makes is $(v - t_i) / r_i$, where $t_i$ is the time the person is hired and $r_i$ is the frequency he makes money. However, this value is negative when $v$ is before the person is hired, so it is important that we take $0$ insted if the value is negative. If the total sum is $\ge x$, then the $v$ works and the upper bound of the binary search is set at v. One thing to care about in this problem is possibly overflowing the long long limit because the sum for each query can be as large as $n*v$. $n$ can be $10^5$, and $v$ goes up to $10^{15}$, so $n*v$ might go to $10^{20}$, above long long limit. The solution to this issue is to check after each person's earned amount if the target has been hit, and if so just immediately stop.
