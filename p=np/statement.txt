PurpleCrayon has recently solved P=NP! He refused to share his proof (or his $1000000 prize as part of the raffle prize pool) so we cannot use it as our Very Easy 1. Instead, we decided to create our own P=NP, so here it is. Count the number of solutions to the equation P=N*P when 0 <= P <= p and 0 <= N <= n.

Input:

One line with two integers, n and p. (1 <= n, p, <= 1000). Note that despite n and p being greater than 0, N and P in the equation can be greater than or equal to 0.

Output:

A single integer denoting the number of pairs (N, P) such that P=N*P and (0 <= N <= n) and (0 <= P <= p).

Sample input:

2 2

Sample output:

5

Explanation

The valid pairs of (N, P) are (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0).
