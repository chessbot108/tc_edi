The average of a set of numbers is just the sum of all the elements divided by the size of that set. To maximize the average we maximize the sum of the remaining elements because the amount of elements will always be N-1 after we remove one element. Therefore it is always optimal to remove the smallest element. To get the average rounded to the nearest tenth, multiply everything by 10 when summing or getting the minimum to keep everything an integer. Then at the end divide it by ten and convert it to a double to get the answer. Also note that it is always optimal to remove an element, as the smallest element of the array is <= the average. Finding the sum and the minimum of an array is just linear time, so the complexity is O(N).
