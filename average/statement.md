# Average

## statement
Elijah has taken some tests and he didnâ€™t do as well as he liked. So he decided to use his coding skills to hack into the grading system. The problem is, to be lowkey about it, he only will delete one test score.

What is the maximum average score he can get after deleting one test score (rounded down to the nearest tenth, i.e. $3.46$ would be rounded down to $3.4$).

## input format

The first line contains $N$ $(2 \leq N \leq 1000)$, $N$ being the number of test scores.

The next line contains $N$ integers $a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n$ where $a_i$ represents the test score Elijah got on test $i$ $(0 \leq a_i \leq 100)$.

## output format

Please output the maximum possible average, rounded down to the nearest tenth, of the remaining test scores given that he can remove one test.

\*Note, if the answer rounds to an integer please output the tenth place, for example, if the average was $5$ output $5.0$.
