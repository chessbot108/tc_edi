The answer is clearly at least N since we can just select any row. Call the original grid A. Let’s create a new N-1 X N grid B where B[i][j] = 1 if A[i][j] == A[i+1][j]. Realize now that any W x L rectangle in A where all rows are the same is just a W-1 X L rectangle of 1’s in B. The problem has been simplified to finding the largest rectangle of all 1’s in B. 

This is a well known problem which can be solved by iterating over the bottom row of the rectangle. Now for each bottom row, we find the maximum area of a rectangle in the histogram of 1’s with base at that bottom row (the bars of the histogram are consecutive 1’s in a column where the last 1 is at the bottom row). To do this, realize the top of the largest rectangle must be at the top of one of the bars of the histogram. We iterate over this top, so we have already bound the top and bottom of the rectangle and only need to bound the sides. To do this, we just need to find the first bar of the histogram to the left and right of the current bar that has a smaller height/top. We can find this for all bars in O(N) using NSE with a stack. It takes O(N) time for each bottom row and thus O(N^2) time in total. Let C be the converted area of that rectangle in A. The answer is max(N,C).

Time Complexity: O(N^2)
