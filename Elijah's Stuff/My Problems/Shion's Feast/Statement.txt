Formal:
You are given an array A of N integers. A_i <= 10^6. There will be multiple test cases per test, but the total sum of N over all test cases is <= 10^5. The beauty of an array is defined as max(lcm(A_i,A_j)) over all i < j. However, you can add a single integer B <= K*max(A[i], K <= 10. Print the integer B that maximizes the beauty of the array.

Final:
Shion is cooking an amazing feast for youâ€”so amazing that her toxic food sometimes melts through the bowl! She uses $N (1 \leq N \leq 10^5)$ ingredients where the quantity of the $i$th ingredient is $A_i (1 \leq A_i \leq 10^5)$. The tastiness of the meal is the maximum of $lcm(A_i, A_j)$ over all $i < j$. You donâ€™t want to acquire the poison resistance skill after eating her food, so you decide to sneak in an extra ingredient with quantity $B (1 \leq B \leq K \cdot max(A_i), \, 2 \leq K \leq 10)$ for Shion to also use. Find the value of $B$ that maximizes the tastiness of your potentially final feast!

Input:
The first line contains one integer, $T (1 \leq T \leq 10^4)$, the number of test cases. Then $T$ test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two integers, $N, K$.

The second line of each test case contains $N$ integers, $A_1, A_2, \dots , A_N$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.

Output:
For each test case, output the value of $B$ that maximizes the tastiness of your feast.

Sample Explanation:
For the first test case, $B$ can be $1$ or $2$. $B=2$ gives tastiness $ = max(lcm(1,1), \, lcm(1,1), \, lcm(1,1), \, lcm(1,2), \, lcm(1,2), \, lcm(1,2)) = 2$, which is the maximum, so $2$ is the answer.

For the second test case, $B$ can be $1, \, 2, \, 3,$ or $4$. $B=3$ gives tastiness $ = max(lcm(1,1), lcm(1,2), lcm(1,2), lcm(1,3), lcm(1,3) ,lcm(2,3)) = 6 $, which is the maximum, so $3$ is the answer.
