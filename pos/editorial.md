Note that the only time there are multiple different ways to order a problem set is when a difficulty $d$ appears multiple times. If the frequency of a difficulty $d$ in a list is $c_d$, then the number of ways that the problem with difficulty $d$ can be ordered is $c_d!$ since there are $c_d$ different indicies to be distrubited. The answer is then just the product of $c_d!$ over all $d$. We can precompute the factorials and frequencies in $O(N)$ time, and thus the complexity is linear.
